Chapter: 1 - Introduction to CSS
A CSS (cascading style sheet) file allows you to separate your web sites
(X)HTML content from it's style. As always you use your (X)HTML file to
arrange the content, but all of the presentation (fonts, colors,
background, borders, text formatting, link effects & so on...) are
accomplished within a CSS.
At this point you have some choices of how to use the CSS, either
internally or externally.
Internal Stylesheet
First we will explore the internal method. This way you are simply placing
the CSS code within the <head></head> tags of each (X)HTML file you
want to style with the CSS. The format for this is shown in the example
below.
<head>
<title><title>
<style type="text/css">
CSS Content Goes Here
</style>
</head>
<body>
With this method each (X)HTML file contains the CSS code needed to
style the page. Meaning that any changes you want to make to one
page, will have to be made to all. This method can be good if you need
to style only one page, or if you want different pages to have varying
styles.
External Stylesheet
Next we will explore the external method. An external CSS file can be
created with any text or HTML editor such as "Notepad" or
"Dreamweaver". A CSS file contains no (X)HTML, only CSS. You simply
save it with the .css file extension. You can link to the file externally by
placing one of the following links in the head section of every (X)HTML
file you want to style with the CSS file.
<link rel="stylesheet"
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
type="text/css" href="Path To
stylesheet.css" />
Or you can also use the @import method as shown below
Page 1 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
<style type="text/css">@import url(Path To
stylesheet.css)</style>
Either of these methods are achieved by placing one or the other in the
head section as shown in example below.
<head>
<title><title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"href="style.css" />
</head>
<body>
or
<head>
<title><title>
<style type="text/css"> @import url(Path To stylesheet.css)
</style>
</head>
<body>
By using an external style sheet, all of your (X)HTML files link to one
CSS file in order to style the pages. This means, that if you need to alter
the design of all your pages, you only need to edit one .css file to make
global changes to your entire website.
Here are a few reasons this is better.
Easier Maintenance
Reduced File Size
Reduced Bandwidth
Improved Flexibility
Are you getting the idea? It's really cool.
Cascading Order
In the previous paragraphs, I have explained how to link to a css file
either internally or externally. If you understood, than I am doing a good
job. If not don't fret, there is a long way to go before we are finished.
Assuming you have caught on already, you are probably asking, well can
I do both? The answer is yes. You can have both internal, external, and
now wait a minute a third way? Yes inline styles also.
Inline Styles
I have not mentioned them until now because in a way they defeat the
purpose of using CSS in the first place. Inline styles are defined right in
the (X)HTML file along side the element you want to style. See example
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
below.
<p style="color: #ff0000;">Some red text</p>
Page 2 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
Some red text
Inline styles will NOT allow the user to change styles of elements or text
formatted this way
So, which is better?
So with all these various ways of inserting CSS into your (X)HTML files,
you may now be asking well which is better, and if I use more than one
method, in what order do these different ways load into my browser?
All the various methods will cascade into a new "pseudo" stylesheet in
the following order:
1. Inline Style (inside (X)HTML element)
2. Internal Style Sheet (inside the <head> tag)
3. External Style Sheet
As far as which way is better, it depends on what you want to do. If you
have only one file to style then placing it within the <head></head>
tags (internal) will work fine. Though if you are planning on styling
multiple files then the external file method is the way to go.
Choosing between the <link related=> & the @import methods are
completely up to you. I will mention that the @import method may take
a second longer to read the CSS file in Internet Explorer than the <link
related=> option. To combat this see Flash of unstyled content
Users with Disabilities
The use of external style sheets also can benefit users that suffer from
disabilities. For instance, a user can turn off your stylesheet or substitute
one of there own to increase text size, change colors and so on. For
more information on making your website accessible to all users please
read Dive into accessibility
Power Users
Swapping stylesheets is beneficial not only for users with disabilities, but
also power users who are particular about how they read Web
documents.
Browser Issues
You will discover as you delve farther into the world of CSS that all
browsers are not created equally, to say the least. CSS can and will
render differently in various browsers causing numerous headaches.
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
Chapter 2 - CSS Syntax
Page 3 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
The syntax for CSS is different than that of (X)HTML markup. Though it
is not too confusing, once you take a look at it. It consists of only 3
parts.
selector { property: value }
The selector is the (X)HTML element that you want to style. The property
is the actual property title, and the value is the style you apply to that
property.
Each selector can have multiple properties, and each property within that
selector can have independent values. The property and value are
seperated with a colon and contained within curly brackets. Multiple
properties are seperated by a semi colon. Multiple values within a
property are sperated by commas, and if an individual value contains
more than one word you surround it with quotation marks. As shown
below.
body {
background: #eeeeee;
font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, Arial, serif;
}
As you can see in the above code I have seperated the color from the
font-family with a semi-colon, seperated the various fonts with commas
and contained the "Trebuchet MS" within quotations marks. The final
result sets the body color to light grey, and sets the font to ones that
most users will have installed on there computer.
I have changed the way I layout my code, but you can arrange it in one
line if you choose. I find that it is more readable if I spread each
property to a seperate line, with a 2 space indention.
Inheritance
When you nest one element inside another, the nested element will
inherit the properties assigned to the containing element. Unless you
modify the inner elements values independently.
For example, a font declared in the body will be inherited by all text in
the file no matter the containing element, unless you declare another
font for a specific nested element.
body {font-family: Verdana, serif;}
Now all text within the (X)HTML file will be set to Verdana.
If you wanted to style certain text with another font, like an h1 or a
paragraph then you could do the following.
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
h1 {font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;}
p {font-family: Tahoma, serif;}
Page 4 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
Now all <h1> tags within the file will be set to Georgia and all <p> tags
are set to Tahoma, leaving text within other elements unchanged from
the body declaration of Verdana.
There are instances where nested elements do not inherit the containing
elements properties.
For example, if the body margin is set to 20 pixels, the other elements
within the file will not inherit the body margin by default.
body {margin: 20px;}
Combining Selectors
You can combine elements within one selector in the following fashion.
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
color: #009900;
font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;
}
As you can see in the above code, I have grouped all the header
elements into one selector. Each one is seperated by a comma. The final
result of the above code sets all headers to green and to the specified
font. If the user does not have the first font I declared it will go to
another sans-serif font the user has installed on there computer.
Comment tags
Comments can be used to explain why you added certain selectors within
your css file. So as to help others who may see your file, or to help you
remember what you we're thinking at a later date. You can add
comments that will be ignored by browsers in the following manner.
/* This is a comment */
You will note that it begins with a / (forward slash) and than an *
(asterisks) then the comment, then the closing tag which is just
backward from the opening tag * (asterisks) then the / (forward slash).
Chapter 3: CSS Classes
The class selector allows you to style items within the same (X)HTML
element differently. Similiar to what I mentioned in the introduction
about inline styles. Except with classes the style can be overwritten by
changing out stylesheets. You can use the same class selector again and
again within an (X)HTML file.
To put it more
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
simply, this sentence you are reading is defined in my
CSS file with the following.
p {
Page 5 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
font-size: small;
color: #333333
}
Pretty simple, but lets say that I wanted to change the word "sentence"
to green bold text, while leaving the rest of the sentence untouched. I
would do the following to my (X)HTML file.
<p>
To put it more simply, this <span
class="greenboldtext">sentence</span> you are reading is styled
in my CSS file by the following.
</p>
Then in my CSS file I would add this style selector:
.greenboldtext{
font-size: small;
color: #008080;
font-weight: bold;
}
The final result would look like the following:
To put it more simply, this sentence you are reading is styled in my CSS
file by the following.
Please note that a class selector begins with a ( . ) period. The reason I
named it "greenboldtext" is for example purposes, you can name it
whatever you want. Though I do encourage you to use selector names
that are descriptive. You can reuse the "greenboldtext" class as many
times as you want.
Chapter 4: CSS IDs
IDs are similar to classes, except once a specific id has been declared it
cannot be used again within the same (X)HTML file.
I generally use IDs to style the layout elements of a page that will only
be needed once, whereas I use classes to style text and such that may
be declared multiple times.
The main container for this page is defined by the following.
<div id="container">
Everything within my document is inside this division.
</div>
I have chosen the id selector for the "container" division over a class,
because I only need to use it one time within this file.
Then in my CSS file I have the following:
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
#container{
width: 80%;
Page 6 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
padding: 20px;
border: 1px solid #666;
background: #ffffff;
}
You will notice that the id selector begins with a ( # ) number sign instead
of a ( . ) period, as the class selector does.
Chapter 5: CSS Divisions
Ok so you have finished the first 4 chapters in my series. You have
learned the very basics of CSS, how the syntax works and a bit about
classes and IDs. Now we are gonna take a quick break from CSS and
focus on the (X)HTML side of using it.
Divsions
Divisions are a block level (X)HTML element used to define sections of an
(X)HTML file. A division can contain all the parts that make up your
website. Including additional divisions, spans, images, text and so on.
You define a division within an (X)HTML file by placing the following
between the <body></body> tags:
<div>
Site contents go here
</div>
Though most likely you will want to add some style to it. You can do that
in the following fashion:
<div id="container">
Site contents go here
</div>
The CSS file contains this:
#container{
width: 70%;
margin: auto;
padding: 20px;
border: 1px solid #666;
background: #ffffff;
}
Now everything within that division will be styled by the "container" style
rule, I defined within my CSS file. A division creates a linebreak by
default. You can use both classes and IDs with a division tag to style
sections of your website.
Chapter 6: CSS Spans
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
Spans are very similar to divisions except they are an inline element
Page 7 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
declared.
You can use the span tag to style certain areas of text, as shown in the
following:
<span class="italic">This text is italic</span>
Then in my CSS file:
.italic{
font-style: italic;
}
The final result is: This text is italic.
The purpose of the last 2 chapters was to provide you with a basis for
using CSS in an (X)HTML file. For a more detailed explaination of XHTML
please visit W3Schools
Chapter 7: CSS Margins
Inherited: No
As you may have guessed, the margin property declares the margin
between an (X)HTML element and the elements around it. The margin
property can be set for the top, left, right and bottom of an element.
(see example below)
margin-top: length percentage or auto;
margin-left: length percentage or auto;
margin-right: length percentage or auto;
margin-bottom: length percentage or auto;
As you can also see in the above example you have 3 choices of values
for the margin property
length
percentage
auto
You can also declare all the margins of an element in a single property as
follows:
margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
If you declare all 4 values as I have above, the order is as follows:
1. top
2. right
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
3. bottom
4. left
Page 8 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
If only one value is declared, it sets the margin on all sides. (see below)
margin: 10px;
If you only declare two or three values, the undeclared values are taken
from the opposing side. (see below)
margin: 10px 10px; /* 2 values */
margin: 10px 10px 10px; /* 3 values */
You can set the margin property to negative values. If you do not
declare the margin value of an element, the margin is 0 (zero).
margin: -10px;
Elements like paragraphs have default margins in some browsers, to
combat this set the margin to 0 (zero).
p {margin: 0;}
Note: You do not have to add px (pixels) or whatever units you use, if
the value is 0 (zero).
You can see in the example below, the elements for this site are set to
be 20px (pixels) from the body
body{
margin: 20px;
background: #eeeeee;
font-size: small;
font-family: Tahoma, Arial, "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica, sans-
serif;
text-align: left;
}
Chapter 8: CSS Padding
Inherited: No
Padding is the distance between the border of an (X)HTML element and
the content within it.
Most of the rules for margins also apply to padding, except there is no
"auto" value, and negative values cannot be declared for padding.
padding-top: length percentage;
padding-left: length percentage;
padding-right: length percentage;
padding-bottom: length percentage;
As you can also
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
see in the above example you have 2 choices of values
for the padding property
length
Page 9 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
percentage
You can also declare all the padding of an element in a single property as
follows:
padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
If you declare all 4 values as I have above, the order is as follows:
1. top
2. right
3. bottom
4. left
If only one value is declared, it sets the padding on all sides. (see below)
padding: 10px;
If you only declare two or three values, the undeclared values are taken
from the opposing side. (see below)
padding: 10px 10px; /* 2 values */
padding: 10px 10px 10px; /* 3 values */
If you do not declare the padding value of an element, the padding is 0
(zero).
Note: You do not have to add px (pixels) or whatever units you use, if
the value is 0 (zero).
You can see in the example below, the main container for this site has
30px (pixels) of padding between the border and the text.
#container{
width: 70%;
margin: auto;
padding: 30px;
border: 1px solid #666;
background: #ffffff;
}
Chapter 9: CSS Text Properties
Inherited: Yes
Color
You can set the color of text with the following:
color: value;
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
Possible values are
Page 10 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
color name - example:( red, black... )
hexadecimal number - example:( #ff0000, #000000 )
RGB color code - example:( rgb(255, 0, 0), rgb(0, 0, 0) )
Letter Spacing
You can adjust the space between letters in the following manner.
Setting the value to 0, prevents the text from justifying. You can use
negative values.
letter-spacing: value;
Possible values are
normal
length
Example:
These
letters
are
spaced
at
5px.
Text Align
You can align text with the following:
text-align: value;
Possible values are
left
right
center
justify
Examples:
This text is aligned left.
This text is aligned in the center.
This text is aligned right.
This text is justified.
Text Decoration
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
You can decorate text with the following:
Page 11 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
text-decoration: value;
Possible values are
none
underline
overline
line through
blink
Examples:
This text is underlined.
This text is overlined.
This text has a line through it.
This text is blinking (not in internet explorer).
Text Indent
You can indent the first line of text in an (X)HTML element with the
following:
text-indent: value;
Possible values are
length
percentage
Examples:
This text is indented 10px pixels.
Text Transform
You can control the size of letters in an (X)HTML element with the
following:
text-transform: value;
Possible values are
none
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
capitalize
lowercase
Page 12 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
uppercase
Examples:
This First Letter In Each Word Is Capitalized, Though It Is Not In My
File.
THIS TEXT IS ALL UPPERCASE, THOUGH IT IS ALL LOWERCASE IN MY
FILE.
this text is all lowercase. though it is all uppercase in my file.
White Space
You can control the whitespace in an (X)HTML element with the
following:
white-space: value;
Possible values are
normal
pre
nowrap
Word Spacing
You can adjust the space between words in the following manner. You
can use negative values.
word-spacing: value;
Possible values are
normal
length
Example:
These words are spaced at 5px.
Chapter 10: CSS Font Properties
Inherited: Yes
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
Font
The font property can set the style, weight, variant, size, line height and
Page 13 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
font:
font: italic bold normal small/1.4em Verdana, sans-serif;
The above would set the text of an element to an italic style a bold
weight a normal variant a relative size a line height of 1.4em and the
font to Verdana or another sans-serif typeface.
Font -Family
You can set what font will be displayed in an element with the font-
family property.
There are 2 choices for values:
family-name
generic family
If you set a family name it is best to also add the generic family at the
end. As this is a priortized list. So if the user does not have the specified
font name it will use the same generic family. (see below)
font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
Font Size
You can set the size of the text used in an element by using the font-
size property.
font-size: value;
There are alot of choices for values:
xx-large
x-large
larger
large
medium
small
smaller
x-small
xx-small
length
% (percent)
There is quite a bit to learn about font sizes with CSS so, I am not even
going to try to explain it. Actually there are already some great resources
on how to size your text. (see below)

Chapter 11: CSS Anchors, Links and Pseudo
Classes
Below are the various ways you can use CSS to style links.
a:link {color: #009900;}
a:visited {color: #999999;}
a:hover {color: #333333;}
a:focus {color: #333333;}
a:active {color: #009900;}
Now lets take a look at what each one of the above link styles actually
does.
a:link {color: #009900;}
The first on the list sets the color of a link when no event is occuring
a:visited {color: #999999;}
The second sets the color a link changes to, when the user has already
visited that url
a:hover {color: #333333;}
The third sets the color a link changes to as the user places their mouse
pointer over the link
a:focus {color: #333333;}
The fourth is primarilly for the same purpose as the last one, but this
one is for users that are not using a mouse and are tabbing through the
links via there keyboards tab key, it sets the color a link changes to as
the user tabs through the links
a:active {color: #009900;}
The fifth on the list sets the color a link changes to as it is pressed.
Lets look at an example: Google
If your last visit to Google is not stored in your cache than the above link
to google is blue, if you have already been to google then the link should
be grey. if you mouseover or tab through the links, the link will change
to dark grey, and last but not least if you click and hold the link without
releasing it you will see it return back to the original blue color.
You must declare the a:link and a:visited before you declare a:hover.
Furthermore, you must declare a:hover before you can declare a:active.
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
Using the above code will style all links on your web page, unless you
Page 16 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
Pseudo Classes
You can set links contained in different parts of your web page to be
different colors by using the pseudo class. For example, lets say you
want your links in the content area to have a different color then the
links in the left or right column of your webpage.
You can do this in the following fashion:
#content
#content
#content
#content
#content
a:link {color: #009900;}
a:visited {color: #999999;}
a:hover {color: #333333;}
a:focus {color: #333333;}
a:active {color: #009900;}
Now assuming that you have your main content in a division named
"content" all links within that division will now be styled by this new style
selector. Should your selector have a different name, just change the
#content selector to match your division name.
Then for the links in a column you could use the following:
#column
#column
#column
#column
#column
a:link {color: #009900;}
a:visited {color: #999999;}
a:hover {color: #333333;}
a:focus {color: #333333;}
a:active {color: #009900;}
Once again, this assumes the name of the column division, just change
the name to match yours.
This same method can be accomplished by declaring a class instead of
an id.
a.column:link {color: #009900;}
a.column:visited {color: #999999;}
a.column:hover {color: #333333;}
a.column:focus {color: #333333;}
a.column:active {color: #009900;}
Though in this case you will need to add a class to each link
<a class="column" href="" title="">some link text</a>
But, there is still yet an easier way
.column
.column
.column
.column
.column
a:link {color: #009900;}
a:visited {color: #999999;}
a:hover {color: #333333;}
a:focus {color: #333333;}
a:active {color: #009900;}
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
Then in the (X)HTML file
Page 17 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
<a href="" title="">some link text</a>
</div>
There are other properties that can be added to links other than color, I
was just trying to keep it simple. Almost any property that can be used
to style text and fonts can be used to style links also
Chapter 12: CSS Backgrounds
Inherited: No
Background
You can style the background of an element in one declaration with the
background property.

Overflow Example
As you can see, with this
property you can mimic
an iframe. This box is set
to an overflow value of
"auto". Meaning that if
the contents of the
element break the
boundaries it should add
a scrollbar.
Here is what I have in my CSS file.
#overflow_box {width:200px; height:200px; border-top: 1px solid
#eee; border-left: 1px solid #eee; border-bottom: 1px solid
#eee; padding: 10px; overflow: auto;}
Then in the (X)HTML file I have this:

Chapter 17 - CSS Positioning
Inherited: No
Position
The position property (as you may have guessed) changes how elements
are positioned on your webpage.
position: value;
Values:
static
relative
absolute
fixed
Now, what does all that mean?
Static
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
Static positioning is by default the way an element will appear in the
normal flow of your (X)HTML file. It is not necessary to declare a
position of static. Doing so, is no different than not declaring it at all.
Page 31 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
position: static;
Relative
Positioning an element relatively places the element in the normal flow of
your (X)HTML file and then offsets it by some amount using the
properties left, right, top and bottom. This may cause the element to
overlap other elements that are on the page, which of course may be
the effect that is required.
position: relative;
Absolute
Positioning an element absolutely, removes the element from the normal
flow of your (X)HTML file, and positions it to the top left of it's nearest
parent element that has a position declared other than static. If no
parent element with a position other than static exists then it will be
positioned from the top left of the browser window.
position: absolute;
Fixed
Positioning an element with the fixed value, is the same as absolute
except the parent element is always the browser window. It makes no
difference if the fixed element is nested inside other positioned elements.
Furthermore, an element that is positioned with a fixed value, will not
scroll with the document. It will remain in it's position regardless of the
scroll position of the page.
At this time IE6 (Internet Explorer 6) does not support the fixed value
for the positioning of an element. Thus it will not position fixed elements
correctly and will still scroll with the page. To see this effect in action you
will need to use a standards compliant browser, such as Firefox 1.0
position: fixed;
When positioning elements with relative, absolute or fixed values the
following properties are used to offset the element:
top
left
right
bottom
position: absolute;
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
top: 10px; right: 10px;
Chapter 18 - CSS Pseudo Elements
Page 32 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
The Syntax
The syntax for pseudo elements is a bit different than that of regular
CSS, but it's real close. If you have already read chapter 11 then you are
slightly ahead of the game.
selector:pseudo-element {property: value}
As you can see the only difference is that you place the pseudo element
after the selector, and divide the 2 with a (:) colon.
Or you can assign a class to a pseudo element as follows
selector.p:pseudo-element {property: value}
Using the above code would style all paragraphs within the declared
selector with the pseudo element.
The elements:
first-line
first-letter
First Line
The first-line pseudo element styles the first line of text in a block level
element.
p{font-size: small;}
p:first-line {font-size: medium; color: #ff0000;}
As you can see in the above example paragraphs are set to be a small
font size, but the p:first-line is set to be a medium size and a red color.
The result is that the first line of all paragraphs will be red in color and a
bit larger than the rest of the paragraph.
Though lets say you only want to style a certain paragraph of text with
the first-line element. Thats where declaring a class to the pseudo
element comes into play.
first -line with class
p.special:first-line {font-size: medium; color: #ff0000;}
I have declared a class of special within my css file.
First-Line Example
This is a special sentence I wrote to demonstrate the use and
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
look of the first-line pseudo element. As you can see the first line of this
paragraph is styled differently than the rest of the text within it. All of
Page 33 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
this was done by simply adding class="special" to the opening <p> tag
for this paragraph.
<p class="special">the content</p>
Where the first-line ends depends on the width of the browser window or
containing element, you can resize this page and see that it adjusts as
you change the size of the browser window.
The following properties can be assigned to the first-line pseudo
element:
background
clear
color
font
letter-spacing
line-height
text-decoration
text-transform
vertical-align
word-spacing
First Letter
The first-letter pseudo element styles the first letter of text in a block
level element.
p{font-size: small;}
p:first-letter {font-size: medium; color: #ff0000;}
As you can see in the above example paragraphs are set to be a small
font size, but the p:first-letter is set to be a medium size and a red
color. The result is that the first letter of all paragraphs will be red in
color and a bit larger than the rest of the paragraph.
Though lets say you only want to style a certain paragraph of text with
the first-letter element. Thats where declaring a class to the pseudo
element comes into play.
first -letter with class
p.special_letter:first-letter {font-size: x-large; font-weight:
bold; color: #ff0000;}
I have declared a class of special_letter within my css file.
First-Letter Example
http://www.cssbasics.com/printfull2.html
T his is a special sentence I wrote to demonstrate the use and look of
the first-letter pseudo element. As you can see the first letter of this
Page 34 of 35Print all 18 Chapters - CSS Basics
3/07/07 2:13 AM
paragraph is styled differently than the rest of the characters within it.
All of this was done by simply adding class="special_letter" to the
opening <p> tag for this paragraph.
<p class="special_letter">the content</p>
The following properties can be assigned to the first-letter pseudo
element:
background
border
clear
color
float
font
line-height
margin
padding
text-decoration
text-transform
word-spacing
